                <p>My name is Lukasz Jasinski and I'm a computer science graduate from Nottingham Trent University, I aspire to develop myself within the web development industry as I truly believe this is part of the greater future for modern technology. I undergo various personal study to develop and gain new skills that can improve the quality of created products. My work can be viewed here on this page with good detail about each one and should you wish to further talk about my past work feel free to contact me. My contact information can also be found on this portfolio.</p>
